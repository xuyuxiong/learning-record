The essence of most Internet projects is to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data, called CRUD. 
Front-end frameworks are tools for the CRUD of the browser elements, and back-end frameworks are for the CRUD of the data.


Let's use the front-end framework as an example. First, we must understand how the framework interacts with the browser because the list application requires input elements, buttons, and lists to display.

We need to get the users' inputs and the list of data to add or delete, but also synchronize to the browser, and this step will give birth to MVC, MVMM, and other development concepts.

On this website https://todomvc.com/, you can see most of the front-end frameworks to achieve the code for our0 Todo-list application.
